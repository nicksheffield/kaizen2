todo

[ ] need to add a new field to attrs, like selectable, called "insertable"
[ ] add a user model id to the project so we know which model is the user one.
This allows us to add a "default to current user" option to a relation with a user.
[ ] add new auth tables to schema.json
[ ] add fault tolerance and upgrading to project.json
